                             AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free software license,
   intended to guarantee your freedom to run, study, share and modify
   the software.  It is a strong copyleft license, which means that
   derivative work can only be distributed under the same license terms.

   In addition, the Affero General Public License closes the
   "application service provider" (ASP) loophole.  This loophole
   allows proprietary software to provide a service over a network
   without the user ever having access to the source code.  The AGPL
   ensures that users who interact with the software over a network
   have the same rights as those who obtain the software in a more
   traditional way.

   The AGPL is a modified version of the GNU General Public License
   (GPL), and has been drafted to ensure that users can obtain the
   source code of any program that uses AGPL-licensed components.

   This license is also intended to be compatible with other
   licenses, so that software can be combined together in a way that
   respects all users' rights.

   0. Definitions

   This License refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
   License.  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed
   under this License.  "You" refers to the licensee of the Program,
   and "your" has a corresponding meaning.  "Affiliated Party" means
   an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by,
   or is under common control with you.  To "control" means to own,
   directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the
   voting power of a corporation or other entity.  "This License"
   refers to the GNU Affero General Public License, and "the GNU GPL"
   refers to the GNU General Public License, version 3. 

   "Source Code" means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any
   associated interface definition files, and the scripts used to
   control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,
   "Source Code" does not include the printed format of the work.

   "Object Code" means any non-source form of the work.

   "Conveying" means any kind of propagation that enables other
   parties to make, use, modify, or propagate the work. 

   "Corresponding Source" for a work in Object Code form means the
   Source Code for the work, plus any associated interface definition
   files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
   of the executable.
